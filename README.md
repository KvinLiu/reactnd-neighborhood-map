and show search results
3. `FourSquareAPI.js` this is not a component, but it handle data from foursquare server.

The `service worker` bundled with this app only woks in `production mode`, so in order to make
code production you need to run commond:
`npm run build` or `yarn run build`, the build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
The app production code will be in `build` folder. Then app is ready to be deployed.
